# Paddle The Bay 25' Planning

## Paddle Plan A

Green Light for 08/22 Friday 6am launch @ Teelin Pier

Paddle from Slieve League to Bundoran Quay.

Speed modelling:
- Approximate speed with very light wind breeze ~ 3.5km/hr
- Over 32km direct line - 9.5hrs+
- Over 40km (with minor zig zag and direction offsetting) - 11.5hrs+

Bundoran ETA: 15:30 to 17:30


### Preparation

1. Travel to launch point 1 night before - leave 7pm Thursday
    1. Travel up and stay Thursday night with Ryan's contact in the area
    1. Use Ryan's van for SUP transport
    1. Use second vehicle for ski transport

1. Equipment - 3x SUPs from Owen's. Collect before Thursday evening


### Day of The Paddle

1. Leave pier at 06:00 to photo shoot at cliffs from 06:22 sunrise
1. Begin paddle route at the cliffs from approximately 06:30


#### Route 1 - Direct

Direct line from Carrigan Head to Bundoran Quay via navigation assistance with Navionics Boating app or as backup a compass.

We will aim just right of St Johns and cut in tight by the cardinal buoy, making sure to stay clear of the tidal overfalls. Then we enter the most open patch of water for about 3 hours before we will start closing in on Tullaghan.

Bundoran Pier has no landmark behind it that can be seen at a large distance however it will be about equal distance between the Tulan sand dunes and Mount Aroo.

We begin close to Carrigan Head just after high tide. We are expected to pass the tidal overfalls area 1.5hrs before low tide. We arrive in Bundoran Bay during the middle quarters pushing.


### Safety Planning

#### Injury Risk

Muscle injury tends to occur towards the final 1/4 of a larger endurance event, leaving multiple hours to paddle with an injury.

SUP endurance injuries from repetitive strain can more often occur in the foot, hand, shoulder and neck area.


#### Other Equipment Considerations

1. Boards: If possible, source better race SUPs. Can add +1km/hr
1. High quality paddles. Another +0.5km/hr
1. Duck tape for paddle repairs.
1. Battery packs for 10hr+ smartphone assisted navigation.
1. Water packs to minimize downtime.
1. Gloves for hand blisters.


#### Risk Mitigation

| Condition                                      | Threshold / Trigger                  | Immediate Action                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Sustained pace < 2.7 km/h over 30 min          | μ − 2σ pace threshold                | Alert support; evaluate exit options              |
| Wind gusts > 20 kt or swell > 1.5 m            | Weather safety threshold             | Abort; redirect to nearest safe landing           |
| Body part pain or injury reported              | Self-reported injury change          | Activate relay or extraction                      |
| ETA projections exceed nightfall / safe margin | Forecasted completion > 90% daylight | Trigger extraction or route reversal              |
| Crossing high-risk tidal area out of slack     | Tidal modeling drift                 | Wait offshore or divert via alternative           |
| Heart rate > expected zone + 10%               | Strain detection                     | Slow pace; micro-rest; monitor                    |
| GPS/signal dropout > 10 min                    | Comms failure                        | Fall back to backup tracker; support team alerted |

The route is within close range of land within the first 4 hours, ensuring easy extraction within the group. The route then proceeds out to open water for 2.5 hours. This is the most high risk zone and craft safety is required.

Craft assistance will be required from 11:30 until 14:00.


#### TASKS

- [ ] Schedule specific breaks of 3m

- [ ] Send timestamped updates of waypoint arrival to station.

- [ ] Contact coast guard the day before and send plan of locations / times.

- [ ] Contact coast guard at beginning of paddle.


#### Variables

Using the Garmin Navionics Boating app for open water charting and tracking.

| Tide high Kilybegs    | 18:20 4.01m |
| Tide high Mullaghmore | 18:13 3.8m  |


#### Route Variations

- Shoot photo the evening before and paddle directly from Teelin Pier
- Stopping on land would likely add hours to the journey.


#### Route 2 - Wide of St Johns; Swing by Mullaghmore

Beneficial depending on wind direction swings.

This route could add significantly to the distance

## Route Modelling

### Time Predictions

Expected times for ~ 40km journey

| Speeds          | Time             | Descriptions                                   |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 6km/hr +        | ~ 6.0hrs         | world class ultra pace or very strong backwind |
| 4.55km/hr       | ~ 7.5hr +        | elite flat water breeze                        |
| 4.5km/hr +      | ~ 7.5hr to 12hrs | light effort paddle with 15+KT downwind        |
| 3.5 to 4.5km/hr | ~ 8.0hr to 12hrs | light effort paddle with 10KT downwind         |
| 3.0 to 3.5km/hr | ~ 10 hr to 12hrs | light effort paddle with breeze                |
| 2.5km/hr minus  | ~ 16+ hours      | Worst case                                     |

For reference, St Johns direct to Bundoran Quay in a straight line in ~4hrs is 3.5km/hr


#### Worst Cases - 2.5km/hr or less

- Minor injury
- Severe weather shifts
- Direction calculation error
- Caught in tidal streams

### Route Plans

#### Plan A

1. Ski to the cliffs from Teelin


#### Route Plan Contingencies

##### More Probable Contingencies

1. Ski to cliffs from Teeling
    - 1x Ski assist relay for whole paddle
    - Ease paddle stress and increase speed
    - ~30km paddling each
    - Photo opp at cliffs

1. Boat to cliffs from Teelin
    - Boat to cliffs

1. Leave from Muckross
    - Chart a ~37km path


##### Other Contingencies

1. Leave from Silver Strand
    - No req for boat to cliffs but extra distance
1. Ski lift from Bundoran to Slieve
    - 3x ski’s to distribute people and boards
    - 2x support crew required early morning
    - More rapid deployment
    - Challenge to fit boards on back and motivate support crew during early hours
1. Relay Contingencies
    - 2x paddle to St Johns and switch over
    - Or 1x ski for ¼ to ½ distance and swap


##### Reverse Routes

1. Leave from Bundoran to St Johns and back
    - Leave at dawn and have the choice to either stay the night or paddle back the same day
    - Leave in the evening, stay the night and paddle back at dawn.
    - Avoid logistics of travelling all SUPs to Slieve
