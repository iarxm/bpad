# Paddle The Bay 25' Event Plan

We have two teams.
1. The paddle team with the mission of paddling the bay.
1. The rescue team with the mission of mitigating risk and being ready for worst case scenarios.

This document outlines important information, modelling and possible route variations per conditions for assisting team decisions on the day.

#### Route 1 Forecasting

1. Beginning close to Carrigan Head just after high tide.
1. We are expected to pass the tidal overfalls area 1.5hrs before low tide.
1. We arrive in Bundoran Bay during the middle quarters pushing.


#### Variables

Using the Garmin Navionics Boating app for open water charting and tracking.

| Marker                | Time        |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Sunrise               | 06:22       |
| Sun Hours             | 14hrs 25m   |
| Navigable Hours       | ~ 16hrs     |
|                       |             |
| Sunset                | 20:48       |
| Nautical Twilight     | 22:17       |
|                       |             |
| Tide high Kilybegs    | 06:06 3.81m |
| Tide Low Kilybegs     | 12:11 0.85m |
| Tide high Kilybegs    | 18:20 4.01m |
| Tide high Mullaghmore | 18:13 3.8m  |


### Route Variations

- Shoot photo the evening before and paddle directly from Teelin Pier
- Skip photo shoot at cliffs.
- Stopping on land would likely add hours to the journey.

- Leave later to avoid paddling against the tide.


#### Route 2 - Wide of St Johns; Close By Mullaghmore

Beneficial depending on changes in wind direction.

This route could add significantly to the distance

| WPoint | NM / km | Hrs | ETA   | Description                                 |

    1. Travel up and stay Thursday night with Ryan's contact in the area
    1. Use Ryan's van for SUP transport
    1. Use second vehicle for ski transport

1. Option: Leave from Bundoran early morning at approximately 04:30

    1. Boards: If possible, source better quality race type SUPs. Potential +1km/hr gain
    1. High quality paddles. Another potential +0.5km/hr
    1. Water packs to minimize downtime.


#### Charting

Navigation assistance with Navionics Boating app or compass as backup with heading established beforehand


## Safety Modelling

### Injury Risk

Muscle injury tends to occur towards the final 1/4 of a larger endurance event, leaving multiple hours to paddle with an injury.

SUP endurance injuries from repetitive strain can more often occur in the foot, hand, shoulder and neck area.


### Risk Mitigation

| Condition                                      | Threshold / Trigger                  | Immediate Action                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Sustained pace < 2.7 km/h over 30 min          | μ − 2σ pace threshold                | Alert support; evaluate exit options              |
| Wind gusts > 20 kt or swell > 1.5 m            | Weather safety threshold             | Abort; redirect to nearest safe landing           |
| Body part pain or injury reported              | Self-reported injury change          | Activate relay or extraction                      |
| ETA projections exceed nightfall / safe margin | Forecasted completion > 90% daylight | Trigger extraction or route reversal              |
| Crossing high-risk tidal area out of slack     | Tidal modeling drift                 | Wait offshore or divert via alternative           |
| Heart rate > expected zone + 10%               | Strain detection                     | Slow pace; micro-rest; monitor                    |
| GPS/signal dropout > 10 min                    | Comms failure                        | Fall back to backup tracker; support team alerted |

The route is within close range of land within the first 4 hours, ensuring easy extraction within the group. The route then proceeds out to open water for 2.5 hours. This is the most high risk zone and craft safety is required.

A safety escort craft will be required for definite from 11:30 until 14:00.

- One option is for the whole duration of the paddle each member within the group to cycle through jet ski escort.
- Another option is for each member to act as safety escort for the whole group on the SUP for the first 4 hours, then be joined by ski assist for 3 hours. The first four hours will be the safest window, before we chart into open water whilst fatigued.


### TASKS

- [ ] Consider specific breaks of 3m

- [ ] Send timestamped updates of waypoint arrival to land station.

- [ ] Contact coast guard the day before and send plan of locations / times.

- [ ] Contact coast guard at beginning of paddle.



## Forecasting

General Ski Support
- Oisin
- Carsen
- Don

## Route Modelling

### Time Predictions

Expected times for ~ 40km journey

| Speeds          | Time             | Descriptions                                   |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 6km/hr +        | ~ 6.0hrs         | world class ultra pace or very strong backwind |
| 4.55km/hr       | ~ 7.5hr +        | elite flat water breeze                        |
| 4.5km/hr +      | ~ 7.5hr to 12hrs | light effort paddle with 15+KT downwind        |
| 3.5 to 4.5km/hr | ~ 8.0hr to 12hrs | light effort paddle with 10KT downwind         |
| 3.0 to 3.5km/hr | ~ 10 hr to 12hrs | light effort paddle with breeze                |
| 2.5km/hr minus  | ~ 16+ hours      | Worst case                                     |

For reference, St Johns direct to Bundoran Quay in a straight line in ~4hrs is 3.5km/hr


Worst Case Modelling - 2.5km/hr or less

- Minor injury
- Severe weather shifts
- Direction calculation error
- Caught in tidal streams


#### Daylight Profiling Per Month

| Dates           | Range         | Hours      |
|-----------------|---------------|------------|
| 07/01 Daylight  | 06:40 - 20:24 | ~ 14 hrs   |
| 07/01 Astro Twi | 04:22 - 22:41 | ~ 19 hrs   |
|                 |               |            |
| 08/01 Daylight  | 07:35 - 19:08 | ~ 11:33hrs |
| 08/01 Astro Twi | 5:35 - 21:08  | ~ 16 hrs   |


### Route Plans

#### Plan A

1. Ski to the cliffs from Teelin



#### More Probable Contingencies

1. Ski to cliffs from Teeling
    - 1x Ski assist relay for whole paddle
    - Ease paddle stress and increase speed
    - ~30km paddling each
    - Photo opp at cliffs

1. Boat to cliffs from Teelin
    - Boat to cliffs

1. Leave from Muckross
    - Chart a ~37km path


#### Other Contingencies

1. Leave from Silver Strand
    - No req for boat to cliffs but extra distance
1. Ski lift from Bundoran to Slieve
    - 3x ski’s to distribute people and boards
    - 2x support crew required early morning
    - More rapid deployment
    - Challenge to fit boards on back and motivate support crew during early hours
1. Relay Contingencies
    - 2x paddle to St Johns and switch over
    - Or 1x ski for ¼ to ½ distance and swap


#### Reverse Routes

1. Leave from Bundoran to St Johns and back
    - Leave at dawn and have the choice to either stay the night or paddle back the same day
    - Leave in the evening, stay the night and paddle back at dawn.
    - Avoid logistics of travelling all SUPs to Slieve
