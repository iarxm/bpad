### Route Variations

#### Minor Contingencies

- Shoot photo the evening before and paddle directly from Teelin Pier
- Skip photo shoot at cliffs.
- Stopping on land would likely add hours to the journey.
- Leave later to avoid paddling against the tide.


#### Route 2 - Wide of St Johns; Close By Mullaghmore

Beneficial depending on changes in wind direction.

This route could add significantly to the distance

### Charting

Navigation assistance with Navionics Boating app or compass as backup with heading established beforehand
Using the Garmin Navionics Boating app for open water charting and tracking.


## Safety Modelling

### Injury Risk

Muscle injury tends to occur towards the final 1/4 of a larger endurance event, leaving multiple hours to paddle with an injury.

SUP endurance injuries from repetitive strain can more often occur in the foot, hand, shoulder and neck area.


### Risk Mitigation

| Condition                                      | Threshold / Trigger                  | Immediate Action                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Sustained pace < 2.7 km/h over 30 min          | μ − 2σ pace threshold                | Alert support; evaluate exit options              |
| Wind gusts > 20 kt or swell > 1.5 m            | Weather safety threshold             | Abort; redirect to nearest safe landing           |
| Body part pain or injury reported              | Self-reported injury change          | Activate relay or extraction                      |
| ETA projections exceed nightfall / safe margin | Forecasted completion > 90% daylight | Trigger extraction or route reversal              |
| Crossing high-risk tidal area out of slack     | Tidal modeling drift                 | Wait offshore or divert via alternative           |
| Heart rate > expected zone + 10%               | Strain detection                     | Slow pace; micro-rest; monitor                    |
| GPS/signal dropout > 10 min                    | Comms failure                        | Fall back to backup tracker; support team alerted |


### Section Analysis

1. The group itself will be a self contained safety team with all members having trained as RLSS Beach Lifeguards.

1. Section 1 and 2 is within close range of land.
    1. Major dangers include.
        1. Wildlife: whales and orcas
        1. Boating traffic entering killybegs
    1. Easy group extraction to land by group self sufficiency.

1. The route then proceeds from St Johns Point into exposed open water for 2.5 hours.
    1. This is the most high risk zone and craft safety is advised.
    1. With a 50km/hr ski the paddlers will be within 15m of a ski based at Bundoran Quay.


- One option is for the whole duration of the paddle each member within the group to cycle through jet ski escort.
- Another option is for each member to act as safety escort for the whole group on the SUP for the first 4 hours, then be joined by ski assist for 3 hours. The first four hours will be the safest window, before we chart into open water whilst fatigued.




## Forecasting

August Week 3:

- Good window for paddling.
- Friday may be last window for many weeks but lacks downwind benefits.


Long Range:

- Forecasting AUG W4: Potential storm cycles with swell
- Forecasting SEP W1: Further storm cycles


Safety Crew Availabilities

General Ski Support
- Oisin
- Carsen
- Don
- Conor

| Week/day | Crew Available |
|----------|----------------|
| AUG W3   |                |
| AUG W4   |                |



## Route Modelling

### Time Predictions

#### Speed Modelling

Expected times for ~ 40km journey

| Speeds          | Time             | Descriptions                                   |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 6km/hr +        | ~ 6.0hrs         | world class ultra pace or very strong backwind |
| 4.55km/hr       | ~ 7.5hr +        | elite flat water breeze                        |
| 4.5km/hr +      | ~ 7.5hr to 12hrs | light effort paddle with 15+KT downwind        |
| 3.5 to 4.5km/hr | ~ 8.0hr to 12hrs | light effort paddle with 10KT downwind         |
| 3.0 to 3.5km/hr | ~ 10 hr to 12hrs | light effort paddle with breeze                |
| 2.5km/hr minus  | ~ 16+ hours      | Worst case                                     |

For reference, St Johns direct to Bundoran Quay in a straight line in ~4hrs is 3.5km/hr


Worst Case Modelling - 2.5km/hr or less

- Minor injury
- Severe weather shifts
- Direction calculation error
- Caught in tidal streams


#### Daylight Profiling Per Month

| Dates           | Range         | Hours      |
|-----------------|---------------|------------|
| 07/01 Daylight  | 06:40 - 20:24 | ~ 14 hrs   |
| 07/01 Astro Twi | 04:22 - 22:41 | ~ 19 hrs   |
|                 |               |            |
| 08/01 Daylight  | 07:35 - 19:08 | ~ 11:33hrs |
| 08/01 Astro Twi | 5:35 - 21:08  | ~ 16 hrs   |


### Route Plans

#### Plan A

1. Ski to the cliffs from Teelin



#### More Probable Contingencies

1. Ski to cliffs from Teeling
    - 1x Ski assist relay for whole paddle
    - Ease paddle stress and increase speed
    - ~30km paddling each
    - Photo opp at cliffs

1. Boat to cliffs from Teelin
    - Boat to cliffs

1. Leave from Muckross
    - Chart a ~37km path


#### Other Contingencies

1. Leave from Silver Strand
    - No req for boat to cliffs but extra distance
1. Ski lift from Bundoran to Slieve
    - 3x ski’s to distribute people and boards
    - 2x support crew required early morning
    - More rapid deployment
    - Challenge to fit boards on back and motivate support crew during early hours
1. Relay Contingencies
    - 2x paddle to St Johns and switch over
    - Or 1x ski for ¼ to ½ distance and swap


#### Reverse Routes

1. Leave from Bundoran to St Johns and back
    - Leave at dawn and have the choice to either stay the night or paddle back the same day
    - Leave in the evening, stay the night and paddle back at dawn.
    - Avoid logistics of travelling all SUPs to Slieve
