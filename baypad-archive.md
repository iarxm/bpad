Forecasting August W2
Best Day Predictions

Thursday could be the best day with a light wind on our backs, and a more predictable weather system.
Although there might be a light wind chop towards 3pm which may be just after we arrive.

Daylight Hours: 04:30 to 22:00 ~ 17 hours

Option: Thursday as plan A with Friday as backup.
Option: Saturday
If this week fails keep an eye on the following Tuesday / Wednesday.

All are more than 48hrs away so will change somewhat
08/14 Thursday
Gentle low pressure hanging way off south west of Ireland all day, which may give a degree of certainty to the forecast, and a more predictable direction to movement of air mass. Though itâ€™s sitting at a tricky juncture between the edge off the low and the corresponding high.

The bay will be sitting just on the boundary with the high.

More likely for a W wind.

First half of day 0m wind swell.
0.2m wind swell towards 3pm. Leave at dawn might escape it
08/15 Friday
Pure high pressure swings across the whole country and ocean.
The wind could be lighter to windless but more prone to random fluctuations and a potential offshore breeze later in the day.

0m windswell all day
